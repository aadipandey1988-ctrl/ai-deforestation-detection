# CNN-Based Deforestation Detection Using Satellite Imagery

## Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify satellite imagery into different land cover categories. The model was trained using satellite image data and uses deep learning techniques to identify patterns within images.

## Objectives
- Classify satellite images using a CNN-based deep learning model
- Analyze patterns in satellite imagery
- Build and evaluate an image classification system
